# Capitalisation Fixes v2.20 changelog

It's been a year since the resource pack was last updated, and even longer than that since the last release with new fixes, but this release is here to being the pack back up to speed with the latest Minecraft versions, and it also comes with 4 new bugfixes and 11 new translation strings!

## New bugfixes

### [MC-158539](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC/issues/MC-158539) Awkward/Thick/Mundane Tipped Arrows use a generic name

You can now distinguish between tipped arrows made with awkward, thick, or mundane potions! Previously, they were all simply called "Tipped Arrow", which is a bit confusing.

### [MC-250194](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC/issues/MC-250194) The word "Catalogue" within the "A Complete Catalogue" advancement isn't spelled in American English

This one only affects players who use the English (United States) language, but if you do, you'll notice that the word "Catalogue" actually uses its British spelling. No more!

### [MC-189953](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC/issues/MC-189953) Controls menu calls Super key "Win"

When you're customising your controls in Minecraft, you can bind the Windows logo key. But on non-Windows platforms, it doesn't make sense to call it the Windows key (macOS calls it the Command key, and Linux usually calls it the Super key). Its generic name is the Super key, so that's now what it shows up as in the Key Binds menu. It's now correct on all platforms, with the drawback that it's a bit less intuitive for most users.

### [MC-250153](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC/issues/MC-250153) Some advancement description strings are improperly capitalized

Going back to the pack's roots with this one! Some of the descriptions for Minecraft's various advancements don't capitalise words where they should be capitalised. 13 advancement descriptions have been fixed in this release!

## Additions to existing bugfixes

- [MC-256422](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC/issues/MC-256422) was fixed by Mojang in 24w33a (for release 1.21.2), but if you're using the pack in an older version, it now fixes apostrophe characters in two more translation strings
